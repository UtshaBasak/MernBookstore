## Overview

BookStoreBD is a full-stack marketplace where readers in Bangladesh can buy and sell
both new and used books. It ships three distinct experiences from one codebase:

| Role       | What they can do                                                                 |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Buyer**  | Browse and filter the catalogue, keep a wishlist and cart, check out, track orders, request returns, and chat with sellers |
| **Seller** | List books with photos and condition details, manage stock and pricing, view orders, and answer buyer messages |
| **Admin**  | Manage users, review every order, moderate listings, and approve or reject return requests |

---

## Features

### Authentication and access control

- Email/password sign-up and sign-in, with passwords hashed using `bcryptjs`
- Stateless JWT sessions; every protected endpoint verifies the token server-side
- Role-based authorisation (`user` / `admin`) plus per-resource ownership checks
- Email verification and password reset via one-time codes delivered over SMTP
- Client route guards for rendering, backed by the server as the real boundary

### Catalogue

- Full book listings with author, publisher, ISBN, language, page count and condition
- Category filtering and case-insensitive title search
- Multi-image upload, stored as base64 data URIs on the document
- Stock tracking, with out-of-stock titles automatically dropped from every cart

### Commerce

- Wishlist and cart, both scoped per user
- Checkout capturing delivery division, district, address, contact and payment method
- Promo codes, shipping charges and discounts applied at the order level
- A 16-character order number shared by every line item in a single order
- Order tracking for buyers, sellers and admins, each with its own view
- Return requests with a defect description and supporting photos

### Real-time chat

- Buyer–seller messaging over Socket.IO, with room-based delivery
- Text and image messages, unread counts, and read receipts
- Conversation history with pagination

```

The client never hardcodes the backend origin. Every request resolves through
[`client/src/config/api.js`](client/src/config/api.js), which reads `VITE_API_URL`
and falls back to the deployed API — so pointing the app at a local server is a
one-line change in `client/.env`.

On the server, [`app.js`](server/app.js) exports a side-effect-free `createApp()`
factory (no `listen`, no database connection), while [`index.js`](server/index.js)
owns the bootstrap: validate environment, connect to MongoDB, listen, attach
Socket.IO, and shut down gracefully on `SIGINT`/`SIGTERM`.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js 24** (Active LTS) — `nvm use` picks it up from [`.nvmrc`](.nvmrc).
  Node 22.13+ also works; the floor is `^22.13.0 || >=24.0.0`, which is what
  Vitest and ESLint between them require. Node 20 reached end of life in
  April 2026 and is no longer supported here.
- **MongoDB** — a local instance or a free [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas) cluster
- An **SMTP account** for one-time-code emails (Gmail works with an [App Password](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833))

### 1. Clone and install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/UtshaBasak/MernBookstore.git
cd MernBookstore
npm install          # root tooling
npm run install:all  # client + server dependencies
```

### 2. Configure the environment

```bash
cp server/.env.example server/.env
cp client/.env.example client/.env
```

Then fill in `server/.env` — at minimum `MONGO`, `JWT_SECRET`, `SMTP_USER` and
`SMTP_PASS`. Generate the secret with `openssl rand -hex 48`. The server
refuses to start, with a clear message, if `MONGO` or `JWT_SECRET` is missing
or if the secret is shorter than 32 characters.

### 3. Run both apps

```bash
npm run dev
```

| Service | URL                          |
| ------- | ---------------------------- |
| Client  | <http://localhost:5173>        |
| API     | <http://localhost:4000>        |
| Health  | <http://localhost:4000/health> |

To run them separately, use `npm run dev:server` and `npm run dev:client`.

---

## Running with Docker

Everything the project needs, without installing Node or MongoDB:

```bash
docker compose up --build            # MongoDB + API + client
docker compose run --rm seed         # sample accounts and catalogue
```

| Service | URL |
| ------- | --- |
| Client (Vite dev server) | <http://localhost:5173> |
| API | <http://localhost:4000> |
| MongoDB | `mongodb://localhost:27017/bookstorebd` |

The source is bind-mounted, so edits on the host reload inside the containers.
Both watchers are set to poll, because filesystem events raised on a Windows
host do not reach a Linux container.

After seeding, sign in as any of:

| Role | Email | Password |
| ---- | ----- | -------- |
| admin | `admin@bookstorebd.local` | `Password123!` |
| seller | `seller@bookstorebd.local` | `Password123!` |
| buyer | `buyer@bookstorebd.local` | `Password123!` |

Other useful commands:

```bash
docker compose run --rm test   # the server suite, against the stack's MongoDB
docker compose logs -f server  # follow the API log
docker compose down            # stop, keeping the database
docker compose down -v         # stop and discard the database
```

### Production-like build

To check a real build rather than the dev servers — useful before deploying:

```bash
export JWT_SECRET=$(openssl rand -hex 48)
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up --build
```

The client is built and served by nginx on <http://localhost:8080> with an SPA
fallback, and the API runs unprivileged with `NODE_ENV=production` and a health
check. `JWT_SECRET` is required; Compose refuses to start without it.

## Observability

The API logs one structured line per request through
[pino](https://getpino.io), pretty-printed while developing and newline-delimited
JSON everywhere else.

Every request carries a correlation id, returned as `X-Request-Id` and attached
to each line logged while handling it. An id supplied upstream is reused, so a
trace survives a proxy hop. A report of "it broke around 14:32" can then be tied
to an exact request instead of guessed at from timestamps.

`Authorization` headers, cookies, passwords, OTP codes and tokens are redacted
before anything is written — logs get shared in issues and pasted into chat far
more readily than a database does.

```jsonc
{"level":30,"time":"...","name":"auth","req":{"id":"6b1c…","method":"POST","url":"/auth/signin"},"res":{"statusCode":200},"msg":"POST /auth/signin 200"}
```

Health checks are excluded, since a container polls them constantly and they
say nothing useful. Set `LOG_LEVEL` to override the default for the
environment.

Unhandled 5xx errors are additionally reported to
[Sentry](https://sentry.io) when `SENTRY_DSN` is set. It is entirely optional —
with no DSN, nothing is initialised and nothing leaves the process.

On the client, an error boundary wraps the app, so a render error shows a
recovery screen rather than a blank white page.

## Image hosting

Book covers can be stored two ways, and the app picks automatically.

**Without `CLOUDINARY_*` set** — covers are stored as base64 on the document,
which is how the project started and what a fresh clone does. No account
needed.

**With `CLOUDINARY_*` set** — the browser uploads straight to Cloudinary and
only the URL is stored:

```
Browser ──"I want to upload"──▶ API        (signs the request)
Browser ◀──signature + timestamp── API
Browser ────────── file ──────────────────▶ Cloudinary
Browser ◀───────── URL + public_id ───────  Cloudinary
Browser ──"here is the URL"──▶ API         (stores the URL only)
```

The bytes never pass through the API, so a ten-image upload costs it two small
JSON requests instead of several megabytes of memory and request time.

A returned URL is checked against this account's delivery host before it is
stored. Without that, a caller could pin any URL they liked to a listing and
have it served to every visitor. Deleting a listing removes its assets, so the
account does not fill up with orphans.

To move existing records across:

```bash
npm run migrate:images -- --dry-run     # report only
npm run migrate:images -- --limit 10    # a cautious first batch
npm run migrate:images                  # the rest
```

It is idempotent, and a listing is only rewritten once every one of its uploads
has succeeded — an interrupted run leaves the original base64 intact rather
than a listing with half its covers missing.

## Testing

```bash
npm test              # both suites
npm run test:server   # server only
npm run test:client   # client only
```

| | Server | Client |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Runner | Vitest | Vitest |
| Environment | node | jsdom |
| HTTP | Supertest against `createApp()` | — |
| Database | `mongodb-memory-server` | — |
| Components | — | Testing Library |

The server suite runs against a **real MongoDB**, started once for the whole
run and shared by every file; each file connects to its own database on that
instance, so files stay independent and run in parallel. Nothing external
needs to be installed or running.

`tests/regressions.test.js` is worth knowing about: every case in it maps to a
defect that actually shipped — the cart that stayed full after checkout, the
authentication bypass, contact details readable by anyone. A failure there
means a real bug has come back.

Both suites run in CI on every push and pull request.

The server suite is hermetic: `server/.env` is deliberately not read under
Vitest, and optional integration variables are cleared in each worker. A suite
that passed or failed depending on whether a developer had configured
Cloudinary would be worse than no suite at all.

---

## API reference

Base URL: `http://localhost:4000` in development.

All routes sit behind a per-IP rate limiter (see
[`server/middleware/rateLimit.js`](server/middleware/rateLimit.js)); `/auth` is
held to a tighter ceiling than the rest. Responses carry `RateLimit-*` headers,
and an exhausted limit returns `429`.

### Validation

Every endpoint validates its `body`, `query` and `params` against a Zod schema
before the handler runs, and the handler then works with the parsed result.

A failure returns `400` listing **every** problem, not just the first:

```json
{
  "message": "Validation failed",
  "errors": [
    { "path": "body.email", "message": "Must be a valid email address" },
    { "path": "body.password", "message": "Password must be at least 8 characters" }
  ]
}
```

Schemas also strip unknown keys, so a request body cannot smuggle extra fields
into a document, and type narrowing is what keeps query operators out of
Mongoose — a field declared `z.string()` can never arrive as `{ "$ne": null }`.

### Authentication

`POST /auth/signin` and `POST /auth/signup` return a short-lived access token
in the body, and set a refresh token in an httpOnly cookie:

```json
{ "token": "eyJhbGciOi...", "user": { "id": "...", "username": "...", "email": "...", "role": "user" } }
```

Send the access token on every protected request:

```
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

| | Access token | Refresh token |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Lifetime | 15 minutes | 30 days |
| Stored | Response body, then `localStorage` | httpOnly cookie, scoped to `/auth` |
| Readable by page JavaScript | Yes | **No** |
| Revocable | No | Yes |

The split is the point. The access token cannot be revoked, so it is short.
The refresh token lives long enough to keep a session alive, and because it is
httpOnly an XSS bug cannot lift it. Only its SHA-256 is stored, so a database
dump yields nothing presentable to `/auth/refresh`.

`POST /auth/refresh` exchanges the cookie for a new access token and **rotates**
the refresh token. Presenting an already-exchanged token — the signature of a
stolen one — revokes the entire token family, ending that session everywhere.
`POST /auth/logout` revokes the family and clears the cookie. Resetting a
password revokes every session for the account.

The client refreshes automatically on a `401` and retries the original request,
sharing one refresh across concurrent requests so rotation cannot trip over
itself.

Cookies are first-party because the client and API share an origin: the Vite
dev server proxies the API in development, and nginx does in the production
compose stack. `SERVE_CLIENT=true` makes the API serve the built client itself,
for a single-service deployment.

The server resolves the caller from that token and **ignores any identity in
the request itself**. An `?email=` in a query string is supplied by the caller
and proves nothing, so it is never used to decide what you may see or change.

| Access level      | Applies to                                                                 |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Public**        | `/health`, catalogue browsing (`/book`, `/filter/*`), `/auth/*`, a seller's public profile |
| **Authenticated** | Cart, wishlist, orders, chat, returns, purchases, profile updates, creating a listing |
| **Owner**         | Editing or deleting a listing (seller only), reading or updating an order (buyer or seller only), reading a conversation (participants only) |
| **Administrator** | Listing and deleting users, every order, approving returns                  |

A rejected token returns `401`; a valid token without the right role returns
`403`. The client clears the session and redirects to sign-in on a `401`.

Admins are identified by `role` on the user document. `ADMIN_EMAILS` promotes
listed accounts on their next sign-in, so an existing deployment gains its
administrator without a migration.

## Real-time events

The Socket.IO gateway is mounted on the same HTTP server as the REST API.

| Direction       | Event             | Payload                                       | Meaning                          |
| --------------- | ----------------- | --------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| client → server | `join_chat`       | `room: string`                                | Subscribe to a conversation room |
| client → server | `send_message`    | `{ room, sender, receiver, message, image? }` | Broadcast to the room            |
| server → client | `receive_message` | the payload above                             | A new message arrived            |

## Deployment

Both services are intended for [Render](https://render.com).

**Server — Web Service**

| Setting        | Value                                                      |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Root directory | `server`                                                   |
| Build command  | `npm ci`                                                   |
| Start command  | `npm start`                                                |
| Health check   | `/health`                                                  |
| Environment    | everything in [`server/.env.example`](server/.env.example) |

`MONGO` and `JWT_SECRET` are required — the service will not boot without
them. Generate the secret with `openssl rand -hex 48`.

**Client — Static Site**

| Setting           | Value                       |
| ----------------- | --------------------------- |
| Root directory    | `client`                    |
| Build command     | `npm ci && npm run build`   |
| Publish directory | `dist`                      |
| Environment       | `VITE_API_URL=<api origin>` |

Add a rewrite of `/*` to `/index.html` so client-side routes survive a page
refresh, and add the deployed client origin to `CORS_ORIGINS` on the server,
with no trailing slash — browsers send the `Origin` header without one.

> Serving the client and API from one origin is planned (see
> [`docs/ROADMAP.md`](docs/ROADMAP.md), task 2), which removes the CORS
> configuration and makes an httpOnly refresh cookie workable.

---

## Roadmap

Planned upgrades, in the order they will be tackled, are in
[`docs/ROADMAP.md`](docs/ROADMAP.md): automated tests, Docker Compose,
structured logging, Zod validation, refresh tokens, Cloudinary image storage,
TanStack Query, and an incremental TypeScript migration.
